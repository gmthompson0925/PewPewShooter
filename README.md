# PewPew

PewPew is a third-person sci-fi shooter that I created in Unreal Engine using C++. I had so much fun creating this game, as shooters are one of my favorite generes. I learned so much by creating this game and I also believe this game has helped solidify my desire to become either a gameplay, animation, or UI engineer.

# Main features in PewPew

 - Third person gunplay
 - Advanced AI functionality
 - Full functional health and ammo system
 - Win/Lose Screens
 - Implementation of sounds and particle effects spread across the entire game
 - Implentation of Walking, Jumping, Running, etc. animations for character and AI

# Things I learned from PewPew

 - Animations are not just drag on drop, they are a unique and awesome system of their own! I was able to experiment with blend spaces, state machines and a bunch of other stuff to really bring my character to life!
 - Project collaboration is MAJOR. I was really stuck with trying to debug an error with my ammo system but after sending a few informational messages back and forth with someone who knew how to help, we were able to fix the error through lots of problem solving, but in the end, it works and looks clean!!!
 - Sound is vital to enhancing the player experience. Knowing exactly what sound fits in or mixing some together can really help immerse the player in your game.

# Mistakes I am improving upon from PewPew

 - Casting and pointers. I got to work with these a lot while making this game and I wasn't entirely sure the functionality of either when I began. After spending two weeks communicating with people in forums to try and fix one casting error, I learned so much by one simple mistake! Pointers can be a reference to an object, and you can't arbitrarily cast one object to another. It has to be of a specific type! And pointers help out a lot with referencing different types.
 - Exposing and using variables and functions from C++ to blueprint can really upgrade the developers workflow. In the beginning of this project I was still stuck on figuring out how the flow between the two works. But after realizing how the UPROPERTY and UFUNCTION statements work really helped me with the flow between utilizing C++ and blueprints at the same time.
