# PewPew

PewPew is a third-person sci-fi shooter that I created in Unreal Engine using C++. I had so much fun creating this game, as shooters are one of my favorite generes. I learned so much by creating this game and I also believe this game has helped solidify my desire to become either a gameplay, animation, or UI engineer.
